# About these students

There are `r num_students` students in this group.  **`r length(missing_ids)`** of them do not yet have a baseline MAP score.

```{r child1, eval=missing_logical, child = 'missing_stu.Rmd'}

```


# `r params$measurementscale` Prior Achievement

Here is the historical class average RIT for these students.  (This plot shows all historical data for all `r num_students` students - it is _not_ limited to continuously enrolled students.  It does, however, exclude students who have transferred out of the school and are no longer part of the presently enrolled `r num_students`-student group.)

```{r rit_trace, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}

rit_trace_simple

```

The background reference lines on the plot above show the  _grade/class/cohort **attainment**_ percentiles.  Another way to visualize the historical data is to track the **attainment percentile** of this group, rather than the RIT.  To be clear: this is still the same data, derived from the same underlying RIT scores.  We're simply showing this data as an mean attainment percentile, instead of using the RIT scale.  

```{r status_trace, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}

status_trace_npr

```

The intuition for this plot is very straighforward - where the line is flat, it means that the class made exactly typical growth for that time period.  When the line moves up, it means that growth was _faster_ than peer grade/classes group.  If the line slopes down, it means that growth was _slower_. 

# Baseline Achievement

The `r num_students` students in this group have a baseline (`r params$baseline`) average RIT of **`r baseline_rit %>% round(1)`**.

For **grade `r params$grade` students**, that baseline puts this class at the **`r baseline_sum$cohort_status_npr %>% round(0) %>% toOrdinal::toOrdinal()`** _attainment_ percentile.  That means that this class's absolute achievement is higher than **`r baseline_sum$cohort_status_npr %>% round(0)`%** of other _classes_ in the country.

# 2016-17 Goals

Our network goal is for each class to grow at the **`r params$growth_percentile_target %>% toOrdinal::toOrdinal()`** percentile.  That's means our **growth** would be in the top **`r 100 - params$growth_percentile_target`** percent of classrooms nationally!

To reach that goal by **`r params$endpoint`**, your students will need to make **`r goal_growth %>% round(1)`** points of RIT growth on average.  That means growing from an average RIT of **`r baseline_rit %>% round(1)`** to an average RIT of **`r goal_endpoint_rit %>% round(1)`**.

If your students grew to an average RIT of **`r goal_endpoint_rit %>% round(1)`** by this Spring, they would be in the **`r goal_endpoint_cohort_status_npr %>% round(0) %>% toOrdinal::toOrdinal()`** attainment percentile.

The chart below shows how much growth is needed to hit other cohort growth benchmarks.

# More growth scenarios

```{r scens}
p_cgp_targets

```

```{r linking, eval=nys_logical, child = 'nys.Rmd'}

```

# Progress monitoring

When we test students again in the Winter, the target is for students to be **halfway** toward their Spring goal.  If the average RIT score for these students is at or above **`r goal_halfway_rit  %>% round(1)`**, that will indicate that your students are on track to reach the growth goal.
