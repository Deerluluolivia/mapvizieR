bulk_student_1year_goal_plot(mapvizieR_obj, studentids, measurementscale,
  labels_at_grade, start_grade, end_grade, growth_window,
  localization = localize("Newark"), aspect_ratio = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{mapvizieR_obj}{a conforming mapvizieR object}

\item{studentids}{vector of target studentids}

\item{measurementscale}{desired subject}

\item{labels_at_grade}{what grade level should the college labels
print at?  Generally the student's most recent test grade_level_season
is desirable.}

\item{start_grade}{show student history starting with this grade level.
We generally go back one year, to show the baseline that the goals derive
from.}

\item{end_grade}{show student history ending with this grade level}

\item{growth_window}{for looking up the window of SGP outcomes, what
growth window should we use?}

\item{localization}{controls names/breakpoints for college labels and
ACT tiers.  See localization.R for more details}

\item{aspect_ratio}{college labels should print at the same
angle as the act ribbons.  if the viz is not square, this requires an
adjustment.  default value is 1, 0.5 would be a rectangle 2W for 1H.}

\item{annotation_style}{style for the underlying template.  See
rit_height_weight_ACT and rit_height_weight_npr for details.}

\item{line_style}{c('gray lines', 'gray dashed')}

\item{title_text}{what text to print above the plot?}
