  match_method = "no matching", first_and_spring_only = TRUE,

\arguments{
\item{mapvizieR_obj}{conforming mapvizieR obj}

\item{studentids}{vector of studentids}

\item{measurementscale}{target subject}

\item{match_method}{do we limit to matched students, and if so, how?
no matching = any student record in the studentids.
UNIMPLEMENTED METHODS / TODO
strict = only kids who appear in all terms
strict after imputation = impute first, then use stritc method
back one = look back one test term, and only include kids who can be matched}

\item{first_and_spring_only}{show all terms, or only entry & spring?
default is TRUE.}

\item{entry_grade_seasons}{which grade_level_seasons are entry grades?}

\item{small_n_cutoff}{any cohort below this percent will get filtered out.
default is 0.5, eg cohorts under 0.5 of max size will get dropped.}

\item{min_cohort_size}{filter cohorts with less than this many students.
useful when weird enrollment patterns exist in your data.}

\item{plot_labels}{c('RIT', 'NPR').  'RIT' is default.}
}
\value{
a list of ggplotGrobs

\description{
see cohort_cgp_hist_plot for use.  Pass a vector of studentids
of *all* desired cohorts.  Plot will facet one plot per cohort.
